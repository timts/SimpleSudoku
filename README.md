SimpleSudoku
============
Program created a while back, moved from codeproject. 

Simple Sudoku Solver with no implementation of any advance rules.

I learned those advance techniques after I created the program, which is able

to solve problems I saw on newspaper. Then I found out the hardest sudoku questions,

some of them require advance rules to solve.
